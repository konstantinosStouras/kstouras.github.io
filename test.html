    <font size=3px> <b>Abstract:</b> We explore the welfare implications of data-tracking technologies that enable firms to collect consumer data and use it for price discrimination. The model we develop centers around two features: competition between firms and consumers&rsquo; level of sophistication. Our baseline environment features a firm that can collect information about the consumers it transacts with in a duopoly market, which it can then use in a second, monopoly market. We characterize and compare the equilibrium outcomes in three settings: (i) an economy with myopic consumers, who, when making purchase decisions, do not internalize the fact that firms track their behavior and use this information in future transactions, (ii) an economy with forward-looking consumers, who take into account the implications of data tracking when determining their actions, and (iii) an economy where no data-tracking technologies are used due to technological or regulatory constraints. We find that the absence of data tracking may lead to a decrease in consumer surplus, even when consumers are myopic. Importantly, this result relies critically on competition: consumer surplus may be higher when data-tracking technologies are used only when multiple firms offer substitutable products.</font>

    <font size=3px> <b>Abstract:</b> While information design has gained significant attention in the recent literature as a tool for shaping consumers&rsquo; purchase behavior, little is known about its use and implications in two-sided marketplaces, where both supply and demand consist of self-interested strategic agents. In this paper, we develop a dynamic game-theoretic model of a two-sided platform that allows for heterogeneity and endogenous behavior on both sides of the market. We focus on illustrating the potential benefits of optimal information provision in terms of managing supply-side decisions, including supplier entry/exit and pricing. Our analysis identifies three distinct mechanisms through which information design may increase platform revenues. Our analysis identifies three distinct mechanisms through which information design may increase platform revenues. First, when the outside options available to consumers and service providers are relatively unattractive, information design can be used to mimic the so-called damaged goods effect, allowing the platform to fine-tune its &ldquo;composition of providers&rdquo; and achieve a more revenue-efficient matching between supply and demand. Second, when consumers and/or providers have access to relatively attractive outside options, information design can help the platform increase its &ldquo;transaction volume&rdquo; significantly; interestingly, we find that in order to ramp up its throughput, the platform may need to understate the quality of its best providers. Third, when the platform uses commission subsidies to resolve the cold-start problem and incentivize the entry of new providers, information design can help achieve the same goal while extracting &ldquo;higher commission revenues&rdquo;; thus, we highlight the role of information design as a substitute for commission subsidies. Overall, our numerical experiments suggest that, by influencing the providers&rsquo; decisions, optimal information provision can lead to a substantial increase in platform revenues.</font>

<div id="strategic_platforms" class="pub-abs" style="display: none;">
  
    <font size=3px> <b>Abstract:</b> wo-sided platforms play an important role in reducing frictions and facilitating trade, and in doing so they increasingly engage in collecting and processing data about supply and demand. This paper establishes that platforms have an incentive to strategically disclose (coarse) information about demand to the supply side as this can considerably boost their profits. However, this practice may also adversely affect the welfare of consumers. By optimally designing its information disclosure policy, a platform can influence the entry and pricing decisions of its potential suppliers. In general, it is optimal for the platform to disclose its information only partially to either nudge entry when it is a priori costly for suppliers to join or, conversely, discourage it when suppliers do not have access to attractive outside options. On the other hand, consumers may end up being worse off as they have access to fewer trading options and/or face higher prices compared to when the platform refrains from sharing any demand information to its potential suppliers.</font>

    <font size=3px> <b>Abstract:</b> Agricultural innovation can help farmers improve their productivity, reduce their environmental impact, and address the challenges associated with ever-changing soil, weather, and market conditions. Promoting innovation often requires government support as a way to incentivize producers to experiment with (and then eventually adopt) cutting-edge practices. We investigate the effectiveness of a number of policy instruments, i.e., taxes and subsidies, in terms of their impact on the adoption of innovative production methods, producers&rsquo; profits, consumer surplus, and return on government expenditure. We contribute to the existing literature by investigating not only the policy maker&rsquo;s role in encouraging innovation but also the role of consumer preferences and learning-by-doing benefits of new production methods. Our setting features producers with access to traditional and innovative production methods and consumers that have a higher valuation for the output of the innovative method. We develop a model to analyze producers&rsquo; decisions of whether to experiment with a new production method when facing uncertainty about their production yield as well as the benefits associated with learning-by-doing. Our findings indicate that using only taxes encourages experimentation with new production methods but decreases social welfare. Utilizing only subsidies outperforms policies that involve both taxes and subsidies in achieving higher social welfare but the converse is true in achieving a higher experimentation rate. We show that zero-expenditure policies result in a decline in social welfare unless producers face financial barriers when making the costly transition to new methods. The insights we generate can help policy makers design policies to achieve specific objectives, e.g., target experimentation/adoption rates. We illustrate their applicability by conducting a numerical study using data on conventional and organic egg production in Denmark. The study generates concrete policy recommendations to achieve the organic production goal set by the Danish government.</font>

    <font size=3px> <b>Abstract:</b> We explore marketplace design in the context of a B2B platform specializing in liquidation auctions. Even when the platform&rsquo;s aggregate levels of supply and demand remain fixed, we establish that the platform&rsquo;s ability to use its design levers to manage the availability of supply over time yields significant value. We study two such levers, each using the platform&rsquo;s availability of supply as a means to incentivize participation from buyers who decide strategically when/how often to participate. First, the platform&rsquo;s <em>listing policy</em> sets the ending times of incoming auctions (hence, the frequency of market clearing). Exploiting a natural experiment, we illustrate that consolidating auctions&rsquo; ending times to certain weekdays increases the platform&rsquo;s revenues by 7.3% mainly by inducing a higher level of bidder participation. The second lever is a <em>recommendation system</em> that can be used to reveal information about real-time market thickness to potential bidders. The optimization of these levers highlights a novel trade-off.  Namely, when the platform consolidates auctions&rsquo; ending times, more bidders may participate in the marketplace (demand-side competition); but ultimately auctions for substitutable goods cannibalize one another (supply-side competition).  To optimize these design decisions, we estimate a structural model that endogenizes bidders&rsquo; dynamic behavior, i.e., their decisions on whether/how often to participate in the marketplace and how much to bid.  We find that appropriately designing a recommendation system yields an additional revenue increase (on top of the benefits obtained by optimizing the platform&rsquo;s listing policy) by reducing supply-side cannibalization and altering the composition of participating bidders.</font>

<div id="supply" class="pub-abs" style="display: none;">
  
    <font size=3px> <b>Abstract:</b> This paper studies multi-tier supply chain networks in the presence of disruption risk. Firms decide how to source their inputs from upstream suppliers so as to maximize their expected profits, and prices of intermediate goods are set so that  markets clear. We provide an explicit characterization of equilibrium prices and profits, which allows us to derive insights into how the network structure, i.e., the number of firms in each tier, production costs, and disruption risk, affect firms&rsquo; profits. We discuss the prescriptive implications of our findings by exploring how a firm should prioritize among its (direct and indirect) suppliers when investing in improving their production reliability. Furthermore, we establish that networks that maximize profits for firms that operate in different stages of the production process, i.e., for the upstream supplier and the downstream retailer, are structurally different. In particular, the latter have relatively less diversified downstream tiers and generate more variable output than the former. Finally, we consider supply chains that are formed endogenously; i.e., firms decide whether to enter and engage in production by forming beliefs about their profits post-entry. We argue that endogenous entry leads to chains that are inefficient in terms of the number of firms that engage in production.</font>

    <font size=3px> <b>Abstract:</b> We explore spatial price discrimination in the context of a ride-sharing platform that serves a network of locations. Riders are heterogeneous in terms of their destination preferences and their willingness to pay for receiving service. Drivers decide whether and where to provide service so as to maximize their expected earnings, given the platform&rsquo;s pricing and compensation policy. Our findings highlight the impact of the demand pattern  on the platform&rsquo;s prices, profits, and the induced consumer surplus. In particular, we establish that profits and consumer surplus at the equilibrium corresponding to the platform&rsquo;s optimal pricing and compensation policy are maximized when the demand pattern is &ldquo;balanced&rdquo; across the network&rsquo;s locations. In addition, we show that they both increase monotonically with the balancedness of the demand pattern (as formalized by its structural properties). Furthermore, if the demand pattern is not balanced, the platform can benefit substantially from pricing rides differently depending on the location they originate from. Finally, we consider a number of alternative pricing and compensation schemes that are commonly used in practice and explore their performance for the platform.</font>

<div id="cournot" class="pub-abs" style="display: none;">
  
    <font size=3px> <b>Abstract:</b> The paper considers a model of competition among firms that produce a homogeneous good in a networked environment. A bipartite graph determines which subset of markets a firm can supply to. Firms compete in Cournot and decide how to allocate their production output  to the markets they are directly connected to. We provide a characterization of the production quantities at the unique equilibrium of the resulting game for any given network. Our results identify a novel connection between the equilibrium outcome and supply paths in the underlying network structure. We then proceed to study the impact of changes in the competition structure, e.g., due to a firm expanding into a new market or two firms merging, on firms&rsquo; profits and consumer surplus. The modeling framework we propose can be used in assessing whether expanding in a new market is profitable for a firm, identifying opportunities for collaboration, e.g., a joint venture  between competing firms, and guiding regulatory action in the context of market design and antitrust analysis.</font>

<div id="information" class="pub-abs" style="display: none;">
  
    <font size=3px> <b>Abstract:</b> This paper studies the strategic interaction between a monopolistic seller of an information product and a set of potential buyers that compete in a downstream market. The setting is motivated by information markets in which (i) sellers have the ability to offer information products of different qualities; and (ii) the information product provides potential buyers not only with more precise information about the fundamentals, but also with a coordination device that can be used in their strategic interactions with their competitors. Our results illustrate that the nature and intensity of competition among the information provider&rsquo;s customers play first-order roles in determining her optimal strategy. We show that when the customers view their actions as strategic complements, the provider finds it optimal to offer the most accurate information at her disposal to all potential customers. In contrast, when buyers view their actions as strategic substitutes, the provider maximizes her profits by either (i) restricting the overall supply of the information product, or (ii) distorting its content by offering a product of inferior quality. We also establish that the provider&rsquo;s incentive to restrict the supply or quality of information provided to the downstream market intensifies in the presence of information leakage.</font>

<div id="hierarchies" class="pub-abs" style="display: none;">
  
    <font size=3px> <b>Abstract:</b> Motivated by diverse application areas such as healthcare, call centers, and crowdsourcing, we consider the design and operation of service systems that process tasks with types that are ex ante unknown, and employ servers with different skill sets. Our benchmark model involves two types of tasks, Easy and Hard, and servers that are either Junior or Senior in their abilities. The service provider determines a resource allocation policy, i.e., how to assign tasks to servers over time, with the goal of maximizing the system&rsquo;s long-term throughput. Information about a task&rsquo;s type can only be obtained while serving it. In particular, the more time a Junior server spends on a task without service completion, the higher her belief that the task is Hard and, thus, needs to be rerouted to a Senior server. This interplay between service time and task-type uncertainty implies that the system&rsquo;s resource allocation policy and staffing levels implicitly determine how the provider prioritizes between learning and actually serving. We show that the performance loss due to the uncertainty in task types can be significant and, interestingly, that the system&rsquo;s stability region is largely dependent on the rate at which information about tasks&rsquo; types is generated. Furthermore, we consider endogenizing the servers&rsquo; capabilities: assuming that training is costly, we explore the problem of jointly optimizing over the training levels of the system&rsquo;s server pools, the staffing levels, and the resource allocation policy. We find that among optimal designs there always exists one with a hierarchical structure, where all tasks are initially routed to the least skilled servers and then progressively move to more skilled ones, if necessary. Comparative statics indicate that uncertainty in task types leads to significantly higher staffing cost and less specialized server pools.</font>

    <font size=3px> <b>Abstract:</b> Participants race towards completing an innovation project and learn about its feasibility from their own efforts and their competitors&rsquo; gradual progress. Information about the status of competition can alleviate some of the uncertainty inherent in the contest, but it can also adversely affect effort provision from the laggards. This paper explores the problem of designing the award structure of a contest and its information disclosure policy in a dynamic framework and provides a number of guidelines for  maximizing the designer&rsquo;s expected payoff. In particular, we show that the probability of obtaining the innovation as well as the time it takes to complete the project are largely affected by when and what information the designer chooses to disclose. Furthermore, we establish that intermediate awards may be used by the designer to appropriately disseminate information about the status of competition. Interestingly, our proposed design matches several features observed in real-world innovation contests.</font>

<div id="multisourcing" class="pub-abs" style="display: none;">
  
    <font size=3px> <b>Abstract:</b> This paper studies sourcing decisions of firms in a multi-tier supply chain when procurement is subject to disruption risk. We argue that features of the production process that are commonly encountered in practice (including differential production technologies and financial constraints) may result in the formation of inefficient supply chains, owing to the misalignment of the sourcing incentives of firms at different tiers. We provide a characterization of the conditions under which upstream suppliers adopt sourcing strategies that are sub-optimal from the perspective of firms further downstream. Our analysis highlights that a focus on optimizing procurement decisions in each tier of the supply chain in isolation may not be sufficient for mitigating risks at an aggregate level. Rather, we argue that a holistic view of the entire supply network is necessary to properly assess and secure against disruptive events. Importantly, the misalignment we identify does not originate from cost or reliability asymmetries. Rather, firms&rsquo; sourcing decisions are driven by the interplay of the firms&rsquo; risk considerations with non-convexities in the production process. This implies that bilateral contracts that could involve under-delivery penalties may be insufficient to align incentives.</font>

    <font size=3px> <b>Abstract:</b> Motivated by the proliferation of online platforms that collect and disseminate consumers&rsquo; experiences with alternative substitutable products/services, we investigate the problem of optimal information provision when the goal is to maximize aggregate consumer surplus. We develop a decentralized multi-armed bandit framework where a forward-looking principal (the platform designer) commits upfront to a policy that dynamically discloses information regarding the history of outcomes to a series of short-lived rational agents (the consumers). We demonstrate that consumer surplus is non-monotone in the accuracy of the designer&rsquo;s information-provision policy. Because consumers are constantly in &ldquo;exploitation&rdquo; mode, policies that disclose accurate information on past outcomes suffer from inadequate &ldquo;exploration.&rdquo; We illustrate how the designer can (partially) alleviate this inefficiency by employing a policy that strategically obfuscates the information in the platform&rsquo;s possession &ndash; interestingly, such a policy is beneficial despite the fact that consumers are aware of both the designer&rsquo;s objective and the precise way by which information is being disclosed to them. More generally, we show that the optimal information-provision policy can be obtained as the solution of a large-scale linear program. Noting that such a solution is typically intractable, we use our structural findings to design an intuitive heuristic that underscores the value of information obfuscation in decentralized learning. We further highlight that obfuscation remains beneficial even if the designer can directly incentivize consumers to explore through monetary payments.</font>

<div id="randomized" class="pub-abs" style="display: none;">
  
    <font size=3px> <b>Abstract:</b> Online retail reduces the costs of obtaining information about a product’s price and availability and of flexibly timing a purchase. Consequently, consumers can strategically time their purchases, weighing the costs of monitoring and the risk of inventory depletion against prospectively lower prices. At the same time, firms can observe and exploit their customers’ monitoring behavior. Using a data set tracking customers of a North American specialty retail brand, we present empirical evidence that monitoring products online is associated with successfully obtaining discounts. We develop a structural model of consumers’ dynamic monitoring to find substantial heterogeneity, with consumers’ opportunity costs for an online visit ranging from $\$2$ to $\$25$ in inverse relation to their price elasticities. Our estimation results have important implications for retail operations. The randomized markdown policy benefits retailers by combining price commitment with the exploitation of heterogeneity in consumers’ monitoring costs. We estimate that the retailer’s profit under randomized markdowns is 81% higher than from subgame-perfect, state-contingent pricing, because the retailer need not limit its inventory to credibly limit markdowns, which permits its jointly optimal inventory stock to expand by 133%. The welfare gain from these larger inventories splits nearly equally into retailer profit and consumer surplus. We also discuss targeting customers with price promotions using their online histories and the implications of reducing consumers’ monitoring costs.</font>

<div id="chronic" class="pub-abs" style="display: none;">
  
    <font size=3px> <b>Abstract:</b> Currently available medication for treating many chronic diseases is often effective only for a subgroup of patients, and biomarkers accurately assessing whether an individual belongs to this subgroup typically do not exist. In such settings, physicians learn about the effectiveness of a drug primarily through experimentation, i.e., by initiating treatment and monitoring the patient&rsquo;s response. Precise guidelines for discontinuing treatment are often lacking or left entirely to the physician&rsquo;s discretion. We introduce a framework for developing adaptive, personalized treatments for such chronic diseases. Our model is based on a continuous-time, multi-armed bandit setting where drug effectiveness is assessed by aggregating information from several channels: by continuously monitoring the state of the patient, but also by (not) observing the occurrence of particular infrequent health events, such as relapses or disease flare-ups. Recognizing that the timing and severity of such events provides critical information for treatment decisions is a key point of departure in our framework compared with typical (bandit) models used in healthcare. We show that the model can be analyzed in closed form for several settings of interest, resulting in optimal policies that are intuitive and may have practical appeal. We illustrate the effectiveness of the methodology by developing a set of efficient treatment policies for multiple sclerosis, which we then use to benchmark several existing treatment guidelines.</font>

    <font size=3px> <b>Abstract:</b> Recent advances in information technology have allowed firms to gather vast amounts of data regarding consumers&rsquo; preferences and the structure and intensity of their social interactions. This paper examines a game-theoretic model of competition between firms which can target their marketing budgets to individuals embedded in a social network.  We provide a sharp characterization of the optimal targeted advertising strategies and highlight their dependence on the underlying social network structure. Furthermore,  we provide conditions under which it is optimal for the firms to asymmetrically target a subset of the individuals and establish a lower bound on the ratio of their payoffs in these asymmetric equilibria. Finally, we find that at equilibrium firms invest inefficiently high in targeted advertising and the extent of the inefficiency is increasing in the centralities of the agents they target. Taken together, these findings shed light on the effect of the network structure on the outcome of  marketing competition between the firms.</font>

<div id="pooling" class="pub-abs" style="display: none;">
  
    <font size=3px> <b>Abstract:</b> Risk pooling has been studied extensively in the operations management literature as the basic driver behind strategies such as transshipment, manufacturing flexibility, component commonality, and drop shipping. This paper explores the benefit of risk pooling in the context of inventory management using the canonical model first studied in Eppen (1979). Specifically, we consider a single-period, multilocation newsvendor model, where n different locations face independent and identically distributed demands and linear holding and backorder costs. We show that Eppen’s celebrated result, i.e., that the expected cost savings from centralized inventory management scale with the square root of the number of locations, depends critically on the “light-tailed” nature of the demand uncertainty. In particular, we establish that the benefit from pooling relative to the decentralized case, in terms of both expected cost and safety stock, is equal to $n(\alpha–1)/\alpha$ for a class of heavy-tailed demand distributions (stable distributions), whose power-law asymptotic decay rate is determined by the parameter $\alpha \in (1, 2)$. Thus, the benefit from pooling under heavy-tailed demand uncertainty can be significantly lower than n‾√, which is predicted for normally distributed demands. We discuss the implications of this result on the performance of periodic-review policies in multiperiod inventory management, as well as for the profits associated with drop-shipping fulfillment strategies. Corroborated by an extensive simulation analysis with heavy-tailed distributions that arise frequently in practice, such as power law and log normal, our findings highlight the importance of taking into account the shape of the tail of demand uncertainty when considering a risk pooling initiative.</font>

<div id="information_exchange" class="pub-abs" style="display: none;">
  
    <font size=3px> <b>Abstract:</b> We develop a model of information exchange through communication and investigate its implications for information aggregation in large societies. An <em>underlying state</em> determines payoffs from different actions. Agents decide which others to form a costly <em>communication link</em> with, incurring the associated cost. After receiving a <em>private signal</em> correlated with the #underlying state, they exchange information over the induced <em>communication network</em> until taking an (irreversible) action. We define <em>asymptotic learning</em> as the fraction of agents taking the correct action converging to one as a society grows large. Under truthful communication, we show that asymptotic learning occurs if (and under some additional conditions, also only if) in the induced communication network most agents are a short distance away from &ldquo;information hubs,&rdquo; which receive and distribute a large amount of information. Asymptotic learning therefore requires information to be aggregated in the hands of a few agents. We also show that while truthful communication may not always be a best response, it is an equilibrium when the communication network induces asymptotic learning. Moreover, we contrast equilibrium behavior with a socially optimal strategy profile, i.e., a profile that maximizes aggregate welfare. We show that when the network induces asymptotic learning, equilibrium behavior leads to maximum aggregate welfare, but this may not be the case when asymptotic learning does not occur. We then provide a systematic investigation of what types of cost structures and associated social cliques (consisting of groups of individuals linked to each other at zero cost, such as friendship networks) ensure the emergence of communication networks that lead to asymptotic learning. Our result shows that societies with too many and sufficiently large social cliques do not induce asymptotic learning, because each social clique would have sufficient information by itself, making communication with others relatively unattractive. Asymptotic learning results either if social cliques are not too large, in which case communication across cliques is encouraged, or if there exist very large cliques that act as information hubs.</font>

<div id="pricing_networks" class="pub-abs" style="display: none;">
  
    <font size=3px> <b>Abstract:</b> We study the optimal pricing strategies of a monopolist selling a divisible good (service) to consumers who are embedded in a social network. A key feature of our model is that consumers experience a (positive) local network effect. In particular, each consumer&rsquo;s usage level depends directly on the usage of her neighbors in the social network structure. Thus, the monopolist&rsquo;s optimal pricing strategy may involve offering discounts to certain agents who have a central position in the underlying network. Our results can be summarized as follows. First, we consider a setting where the monopolist can offer individualized prices and derive a characterization of the optimal price for each consumer as a function of her network position. In particular, we show that it is optimal for the monopolist to charge each agent a price that consists of three components: (i) a nominal term that is independent of the network structure, (ii) a discount term proportional to the influence that this agent exerts over the rest of the social network (quantified by the agent&rsquo;s Bonacich centrality), and (iii) a markup term proportional to the influence that the network exerts on the agent. In the second part of the paper, we discuss the optimal strategy of a monopolist who can only choose a single uniform price for the good and derive an algorithm polynomial in the number of agents to compute such a price. Third, we assume that the monopolist can offer the good in two prices, full and discounted, and we study the problem of determining which set of consumers should be given the discount. We show that the problem is NP-hard; however, we provide an explicit characterization of the set of agents who should be offered the discounted price. Next, we describe an approximation algorithm for finding the optimal set of agents. We show that if the profit is nonnegative under any feasible price allocation, the algorithm guarantees at least 88% of the optimal profit. Finally, we highlight the value of network information by comparing the profits of a monopolist who does not take into account the network effects when choosing her pricing policy to those of a monopolist who uses this information optimally.</font>

    <font size=3px> <b>Abstract:</b> This paper studies a simple model of experimentation and innovation. Our analysis suggests that patents improve the allocation of resources by encouraging rapid experimentation and efficient ex post transfer of knowledge. Each firm receives a signal on the success probability of a project and decides when to experiment. Successes can be copied. First, we assume that signal qualities are the same. Symmetric equilibria involve delayed and staggered experimentation, whereas the optimal allocation never involves delays and may involve simultaneous experimentation.  Appropriately designed patents implement the optimal allocation. Finally, we discuss the case when signals differ and are private information.</font>

    <font size=3px> <b>Abstract:</b> We study the efficiency of oligopoly equilibria in a model where firms compete over capacities and prices. Our model economy corresponds to a two-stage game. First, firms choose their capacity levels. Second, after the capacity levels are observed, they set prices. Given the capacities and prices, consumers allocate their demands across the firms. We establish the existence of pure strategy oligopoly equilibria and characterize the set of equilibria. We then investigate the efficiency properties of these equilibria, where efficiency is defined as the ratio of surplus in equilibrium relative to the first best. We show that efficiency in the worst oligopoly equilibria can be arbitrarily low. However, if the best oligopoly equilibrium is selected (among multiple equilibria), the worst-case efficiency loss is $2(\sqrt{N}-1)/(N-1)$ with $N$ firms, and this bound is tight. We also suggest a simple way of implementing the best oligopoly equilibrium.</font>

<div id="fragmentation" class="pub-abs" style="display: none;">
  
    <font size=3px> <b>Abstract:</b> Maritime shipping is the primary mode of transportation for most raw materials and finished products traded in current supply chains. However, large cargo vessels negatively affect the environment on multiple fronts: maritime shipping contributes about 3% of the world’s emissions of greenhouse gases and the ocean environment further suffers from other pollutants released during travel, while noise produced by engines and propellers has been linked to disruption in migratory cycles of many species. Despite this evidence, approximately 47% of oil tanker and dry-bulk vessels sail empty (ballast) at any point in time: ballasting arises from a variety of factors, including the fact that trade flows are imbalanced and the market for transportation is fragmented. In this paper, exploiting data provided by a leading maritime analytics provider, we establish that consolidating the market for oil tankers could lead to a reduction in ballasting by as much as 30% due to a more efficient matching between loads and vessels. Although such consolidation may be impractical and could raise concerns about market power, we also show that organizing the world’s fleet of oil tankers into shipping pools of 10-20 vessels each (or 2-3% of the total fleet) makes it possible to cut CO2 emissions originating from ballasting by more than 25% (or more than 80% of the total benefits). Thus, we provide another rationale behind the growing prominence of shipping pools in the industry. At a higher level, this work shows the extent of the sustainability gains that can be obtained solely by organizing more efficiently the resources available in today’s supply chains.</font>

    <font size=3px> <b>Abstract:</b> Crowd-sourced content in the form of online product reviews or recommendations is an integral feature of most Internet-based service platforms and marketplaces, including Yelp, TripAdvisor, Netflix, and Amazon. Customers may find such information useful when deciding between potential alternatives; at the same time, the process of generating such content is mainly driven by the customers’ decisions themselves. In other words, the service platform or marketplace “explores” the set of available options through its customers’ decisions, while they “exploit” the information they obtain from the platform about past experiences to determine whether and what to purchase. Unlike the extensive work on the trade-off between exploration and exploitation in the context of multi-armed bandits, the canonical framework we discuss in this chapter involves a principal that explores a set of options through the actions of self-interested agents. In this framework, the incentives of the principal and the agents towards exploration are misaligned, but the former can potentially incentivize the actions of the latter by appropriately designing a payment scheme or an information provision policy.</font>
